# Py_Projects
Welcome to my first Python Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of diverse Python projects, showcasing my programming skills and interests. 


Project list :-

1. TreasureHunt.py : 

This is a text-based treasure hunt game where the player starts in a city and must make choices at various intersections and locations to ultimately find the hidden treasure on an island. The game uses a while loop to keep the player engaged until they either find the treasure or choose to quit.

2. BlackJack.py :

This is a python text-based classic card game called BlackJack where the goal is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. The game is played with one or more standard decks of 52 playing cards. Each card has a value, and your objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
