This is a python text based classic card game called BlackJack where the goal is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. The game is played with one or more standard decks of 52 playing cards. Each card has a value, and your objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.


Features:

Multiplayer Mode: Play with multiple players and compete against the dealer.

Betting: Start each round with a balance of $1000, and place bets to win or lose virtual money.

Player Options: Choose from options like "hit," "stand," "double down," and "surrender" during your turn.

Blackjack Payout: Get rewarded 1.5 times your bet for a natural blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card).

Balances: Keep track of your balance as you play, and see who can accumulate the most virtual money.




Rules and How to Play:

Objective: Beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

Card Values:

Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
    Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
    Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.



Gameplay:

Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards to start.


Players take turns deciding what action to take: "hit," "stand," "double down," "surrender," or "quit."
Actions:


        "Hit": Take another card to try to improve your hand. You can keep hitting until you decide to stand or bust (go over 21).
        
        "Stand": Keep your current hand and end your turn.
        
        "Double Down": Double your initial bet, take one more card, and then stand. This option is available on your first turn only.
        
        "Surrender": Forfeit half of your bet and end the round.
        
        "Quit": End the game and see the final player balances.




Winning:

A natural blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) pays 1.5 times your bet.


If the dealer busts (goes over 21), players win.


If the player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without busting, the player wins.


If the dealer's hand value is closer to 21, the player loses.

In a tie, the player and dealer push (no money is won or lost).



Players can choose to play additional rounds or quit the game.
The player with the highest balance at the end wins the game.
